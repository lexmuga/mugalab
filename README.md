## Overview

The **Model Understanding and Generative Alignment Laboratory (MUGA LAB)** is a research and teaching initiative exploring the **mathematics of interpretability**, **human-aligned generative systems**, and **reproducible AI research**.

This repository serves as both a **research archive** and a **pedagogical framework** — bridging:
- **Model Understanding:** interpretability, calibration, and transparency  
- **Generative Alignment:** human feedback, ethics, and value integration

## Active Course: Predictive Analytics for Text (AY 2025–2026)

A modular course on **text vectorization, embeddings, and model interpretability**.  
Includes synchronized Jupyter notebooks for:
- Traditional & embedding-based vectorization  
- Master split generation for reproducibility  
- Interpretability and SHAP analysis  

[Access the course here →](courses/predictive_analytics_for_text/)

---

## Tools and Frameworks

- **Vectorization:** TF–IDF, Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe  
- **Optimization:** Optuna, DEHB  
- **Uncertainty:** BayesFlow  
- **Interpretability:** SHAP, ECE, calibration curves  

Each lab notebook is aligned with the **MUGA Reproducibility Framework**, ensuring consistent random seeds, master split indices, and transparent logging.
