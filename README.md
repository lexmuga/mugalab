## 🌍 Overview

The **Model Understanding and Generative Alignment Laboratory (MUGA LAB)** is a research and teaching initiative exploring the **mathematics of interpretability**, **human-aligned generative systems**, and **reproducible AI research**.

This repository serves as both a **research archive** and a **pedagogical framework** — bridging:
- **Model Understanding:** interpretability, calibration, and transparency  
- **Generative Alignment:** human feedback, ethics, and value integration

## 🎓 Active Course: Predictive Analytics for Text (AY 2025–2026)

A modular course on **text vectorization, embeddings, and model interpretability**.  
Includes synchronized Jupyter notebooks for:
- Traditional & embedding-based vectorization  
- Master split generation for reproducibility  
- Interpretability and SHAP analysis  

📘 [Access the course here →](courses/predictive_analytics_for_text/)
