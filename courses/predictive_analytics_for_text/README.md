# üìò Predictive Analytics for Text
**Model Understanding and Generative Alignment Laboratory (MUGA LAB)**  
Academic Year 2025‚Äì2026

---

## üß≠ Course Overview

**Predictive Analytics for Text** introduces supervised learning techniques for **text-based prediction**,  
emphasizing **reproducibility**, **interpretability**, and **uncertainty estimation**.  

Students learn to:
- Preprocess and vectorize natural language text  
- Build and evaluate classification and regression models  
- Train deep architectures (MLP, RNN, Transformer, TabNet)  
- Integrate probabilistic inference using **BayesFlow**  
- Communicate findings through interpretable technical reports

- Submission: 5‚Äì7 page technical report + oral presentation  

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Predictive performance and interpretability  
- Reproducibility (fixed splits, random seeds, documented setup)  
- Clarity and depth of reflection in the report
