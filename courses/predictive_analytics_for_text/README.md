# Predictive Analytics for Text
**Model Understanding and Generative Alignment Laboratory (MUGA LAB)**  
Academic Year 2025–2026

---

## Course Overview

**Predictive Analytics for Text** introduces supervised learning techniques for **text-based prediction**,  
emphasizing **reproducibility**, **interpretability**, and **uncertainty estimation**.  

Students learn to:
- Preprocess and vectorize natural language text  
- Build and evaluate classification and regression models  
- Train deep architectures (MLP, RNN, Transformer, TabNet)  
- Integrate probabilistic inference using **BayesFlow**  
- Communicate findings through interpretable technical reports  

---

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

| Objective | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Text Preprocessing** | Tokenize, lemmatize, and normalize text using spaCy/NLTK |
| **Vectorization** | Implement BoW, TF–IDF, and embedding-based representations |
| **Supervised Learning** | Train and evaluate classification and regression models |
| **Feature Analysis** | Use SHAP and calibration metrics to interpret model behavior |
| **Deep Learning** | Construct MLPs, RNNs, and Transformer-based architectures |
| **Uncertainty Modeling** | Estimate predictive uncertainty using BayesFlow |
| **Model Integration** | Combine deterministic and probabilistic models into ensembles |
| **Scientific Communication** | Write structured, interpretable reports and presentations |

## Capstone Project

Each student (or team) develops an **end-to-end predictive pipeline** for text data.

**Requirements:**
- Must include at least one **deep model** and **BayesFlow** integration  
- Ensemble with interpretability (e.g., SHAP + calibration analysis)  
- Submission: 5–7 page technical report + oral presentation  

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Predictive performance and interpretability  
- Reproducibility (fixed splits, random seeds, documented setup)  
- Clarity and depth of reflection in the report
