# Predictive Analytics for Text
**Model Understanding and Generative Alignment Laboratory (MUGA LAB)**  
Academic Year 2025‚Äì2026  

---

## Overview

**Predictive Analytics for Text** is a modular course exploring supervised learning for text data,  
with a focus on **interpretability**, **reproducibility**, and **uncertainty estimation**.

Students will build pipelines for:
- Preprocessing and vectorizing textual data  
- Training classification and regression models  
- Analyzing model behavior using **SHAP** and calibration  
- Incorporating **BayesFlow** for uncertainty and probabilistic inference
