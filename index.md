## 🌍 About MUGA LAB

**MUGA LAB (Model Understanding and Generative Alignment Laboratory)** explores the intersection of  
**mathematical interpretability**, **human-aligned generative systems**, and **reproducible AI research**.

The lab bridges **model understanding** and **alignment** through rigorous, pedagogically oriented frameworks — integrating interpretability, calibration, and value-guided generative design.

---

## 🧩 Mission and Focus

### 🔍 Model Understanding
> *How can we interpret and explain model behavior transparently?*  
Research areas:
- Explainability and feature attribution  
- Calibration and reliability analysis  
- Uncertainty estimation (epistemic and aleatoric)

### 🤝 Generative Alignment
> *How can models remain ethically and contextually aligned with human intent?*  
Focus areas:
- Human-in-the-loop learning and feedback  
- Value-sensitive generation and ethical constraints  
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)

---

## 🔬 Research Axes

| Axis | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Explainability** | Quantifying influence, relevance, and interpretive coherence |
| **Alignment** | Embedding human feedback and ethical priors |
| **Uncertainty** | Modeling predictive confidence via BayesFlow |
| **Optimization** | Adaptive hyperparameter search with Optuna and DEHB |

---

## 🧠 Research and Teaching Synergy

MUGA LAB serves both as a **research collective** and a **teaching framework**, designed to support:

- Reproducible ML experiments  
- Explainable NLP and embeddings  
- Pedagogical prompt engineering  
- Interpretability-driven model analysis
