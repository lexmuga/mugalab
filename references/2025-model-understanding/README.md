## ðŸ§­ Abstract

This reference defines the foundational concepts of **Model Understanding** and **Generative Alignment**, two complementary dimensions of responsible AI.

- *Model Understanding* focuses on interpreting and explaining the internal mechanisms of predictive models â€” how they learn, what patterns they capture, and why they make certain predictions.  
- *Generative Alignment* addresses how generative systems (text, image, or data models) can be aligned with human values, ethics, and intent.

Together, these frameworks support the design of interpretable, trustworthy, and human-aligned generative intelligence â€” the central research theme of **MUGA LAB**.
